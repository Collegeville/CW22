### The College Workshop Series on Scientific Software

The Collegeville Workshop Series on Scientific Software is intended to bring together three communities of scientific software developers: academia, industry and laboratories.  While there are certainly existing exchanges between these communities, we are dedicated to improving awareness of common needs, unique contributions and career paths that span these communities.

The first workshop in 2019 focused on software sustainability.  The 2020 workshop focused on developer productivity.  In 2021 we focused on software teams.  Collegeville 2022 will focus on software design.

### Resources from Collegeville 2021

Recordings and other artifacts from last year's workshop are available at the [Collegeville 2022 website](https://collegeville.github.io/CW22/WorkshopResources/Recordings/RecordingList.html)

### Contribute to Collegeville 2022

Any member of the computational science and engineering community who has an interest in improving scientific software design is encouraged to submit content to build the program of Collegeville 2022: https://collegeville.github.io/CW22/Contribute.  Questions can be sent to Mike Heroux <mheroux@csbsju.edu>.

We welcome the following contributions:
