# Collegeville Workshop Series on Scientific Software

The Collegeville Workshop Series on Scientific Software is intended to bring together three communities of scientific software developers: academia, industry and laboratories.  While there are certainly existing exchanges between these communities, we are dedicated to improving awareness of common needs, unique contributions and career paths that span these communities.

The first workshop in 2019 focused on software sustainability.  The 2020 workshop focused on developer productivity.  Collegeville 2021 focused on software teams.

The Collegeville 2022 workshop theme is TBD.  Have an idea? Let Mike Heroux know (mheroux@csbsju.edu).

More details about this year's theme can be found on the [**Background Page**](Background.md) when available.
