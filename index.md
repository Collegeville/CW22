# Collegeville 2022 moved to 2023
Due to continued complications from the pandemic, St. John's University Events is challenged to provide adequate staffing for on-site events.  Rather than conduct Collegeville 2022 as a purely virtual event, the organizing committee has decided to postpone this year's meeting to the week of July 24, 2023.
